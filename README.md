# Computer Science Portfolio
Welcome to my public computer science portfolio.  This repository highlights my foundational and applied knowledge in the following areas:
- **Python** - Demonstrated through a variety of small to mid-sized projects showcasing scripting, logic, and automation.
- **C++** - Focused on systems-level programming fundamentals and data structures.
- **SQL & Database Management** - Featuring SQL queries and operations on a mock university database, including schema design and data analysis.

Each section contains both independent exercises and contributions to larger-scale projects that demonstrate how these skills integrate into full applications or systems.

> **Note:** Due to intellectual property considerations, some projects may be summarized or include limited code.  Full implementations are available upon request.
