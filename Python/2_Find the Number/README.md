# 🎯 Find the Number

A fun number guessing game where you test your luck (and logic).

**How it works:**
- Set the range (e.g., 1–100)
- Try to guess the number picked by the computer
- Get hints like “too high” or “too low”
- Play again as many times as you'd like!

**Highlights:**
- Uses `random.randint()`
- Score tracking and feedback
- Infinite replayability

```bash
python FindTheNumber.py
